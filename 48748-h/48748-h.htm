<h2>THE DESULTORY REMARKER.</h2>

<h3>No. III.</h3>


<p>He whose object is to make an
impression on the public mind, must
first, as an indispensable preliminary,
secure the public attention. Much
that is said or written, partakes in so
great a degree of an unimpressive
and a common-place character, as to
be utterly disregarded. To succeed
in obtaining the public ear, is as difficult
as it is important. This success
is perhaps most efficiently promoted,
by listening with attention to every
remark of criticism, whether good-natured
or severe;&mdash;by then adopting
the counsels of wisdom, and leaning
on the solid column of experience.
If these papers should fail to acquire
popularity, and, like many of their
predecessors, sink into <em>undeserved</em>
oblivion; it shall not be from the want
of a disposition to please, but from
the absence of higher powers. It is
the peculiar province of genius to
render prolific the most sterile soil,
to invest with interest the most intractable
topic, and to mould into the
form of beauty the most unpromising
materials. For this rare and brilliant
endowment, no adequate substitute
can be found.</p>

<p>Should every public speaker, or
public writer, be required to confine
themselves to what is absolutely original,
or strictly relevant to their subject;
what would become of a vast
majority of the tribe of authors, and
ninety-nine out of a hundred of our
orators in Congress? Of a speech
of three or five hours in length, one
effect may be confidently predicted;
that those of the audience who do not
fall asleep, will be fatigued and justly
irritated, by such an unwarrantable
trespass on their time and patience.
Our national character is not yet completely
formed; but some features of
it are assuming a permanent shape.
Among these, there is one, by no
means calculated to elevate us in the
estimation of the rest of the world.
Instead of that simplicity and Spartan
brevity, by which republicans should
be distinguished, we habituate ourselves
to the unnecessary use of a multitude
of words. <span class="smcap">We are giants in
profession, but pigmies in action.</span>
It has been confidently asserted, that
the speeches of one of the members
of our federal legislature, from Tennessee,
have actually cost the United
States more money, than would defray
the entire expense of completing
the Delaware and Chesapeake canal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Now that the Missouri discussion is
terminated, how <em>honourable</em> to the
nation, it is not my present purpose
to inquire; it would be desirable to
ascertain whether the vote of a solitary
member was changed, by the
endless speeches which were delivered
on the subject. If not, I should
presume it was a pretty clear point,
that they cost the PEOPLE much
more than they were worth; and that
such a prodigal waste of the time and
treasure of the nation, is highly reprehensible.
But instead of arraigning
the conduct of others, and exposing
their weakness and defects, it
may perhaps be the part of prudence
to spare our censure for errors to be
met with much nearer home. By
giving publicity to the following communication,
I trust I shall not trespass
on the indulgence of my readers;
while at the same time I shall evince
a spirit of no fictitious candour, by
which I wish at all times to be actuated.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;You will pardon the liberty
which, as a perfect stranger, I take of
addressing you. I have long cultivated
a taste for literature; not that
which abounds in circulating libraries,
but that which is met with in
those "<em>founts of English undefiled</em>,"
the classical poets and essayists of
Great Britain. Of the latter, I have
a decided preference for <span class="smcap">Addison</span>;
because his humour is as innocent as
it is exquisite; and because his sincere
and fervid piety is diametrically
opposed to every thing like monastic
gloom and austerity. He was a benefactor
to mankind during the course
of his life; and left them his example
in the hour of death&mdash;"<em>See how a
Christian can die!</em>" I have not trimmed
the midnight lamp, in perusing
the pages of sentimental and mischievous
nonsense; but derive the highest
gratification from those books which
have long enjoyed the united suffrages
of virtue. But to my purpose. You
have embarked in an honourable undertaking,
and one in which very few
have been successful. You should
profit, not merely by the wisdom of
those that have gone before you, but
also by their mistakes. I have read
your two first numbers; and unless
some improvement shall take place,
either in your matter or manner, you
will never be a favourite of mine.&mdash;There
is too much unvaried gravity,
and studied elaboration, in them.&mdash;When
we take up a newspaper, or
magazine, we do not expect to meet
with a sermon, however well disposed
we might be to welcome it on a proper
occasion. Permit me to observe,
that a long, prosing, lifeless essay,
<em>will never be read</em>; and, if frequently
met with, will create a distaste for
the journal itself, in which it may appear.
Being friendly to your success,
you will indulge me in repeating,
that should you fail to impart a
greater degree of vanity and interest,
to your future numbers; if you do not
more frequently smooth the wrinkled
brow of care, and assume the aspect
of cheerfulness, you will lose many
of the female readers you have at present,

and will endeavour <em>occasionally</em>

considerably advanced in the vale of

in every department of virtue;
and whose influence on the well-being
of society, is so incalculably
important. What if my temples be

<h2>THE VILLAGE TEACHER.</h2>


<p>In my younger days, I passed a
considerable time in the pleasant village
of G&mdash;&mdash;. The society was
lively and agreeable; and, as it consisted
chiefly of ladies, our usual place
of meeting was at the tea table and the
evening circle. Literature, the news
of the day, and our little amusements,
furnished the principal subjects of
conversation; and although the society
was elegant and well educated, yet
the frequency of our meetings often
drove us, for variety, to the intrigues
and petty scandal of the neighbourhood.
The disposition for this kind
of entertainment became at last so
strong, that we grew ashamed of it;
and resolved one evening to create a
"Court of Scandal," by which all offences
against the good breeding and
charity of speech should be tried, and
whose decisions we bound ourselves
to obey. When I observe how strong
is our propensity for scandal, and with
what greediness evil-speaking is listened
to, I cannot help wishing that
there were such a tribunal in every
one's bosom. Did it exist, or rather
did we suffer the voice which there
speaks, to be heard; we should often
be humbled at its decisions. If we
unmask our actions and our motives,
we shall find this propensity at the
bottom of much of what is called&mdash;virtuous
indignation. At one time,
it assumes the mock appearance of
charity; at another, it tries to hide
itself in sallies of wit, or lurks beneath
a half whispered insinuation, or a kind
doubt, or a malicious inquiry. Its
seeds are deeply sown, and take still
deeper root in the human breast; and
it requires the strictest self-examination,
and the greatest candour, to
avoid being overrun, if I may so express
myself, with this nightshade.</p>

<p>I know of nothing more despicable,
than the little mincing scandal which
buzzes about in our polite circles.
Always on the wing, with honey in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
mouth, and poison and bitterness in
its trail, it spreads the injurious aspersion,
and the doubtful insinuation;
and fastens them, like mildew, upon
the fairest and purest characters. It
is a vice essentially grovelling, and
low-minded, and which grows upon
us at unawares. It advances imperceptibly
through all its various degrees;
from idle curiosity to the deep
and settled malignity, which has no
pleasure but in the weaknesses, the
errors, and misfortunes, of those
around it. Beware, reader! lest
while giving to my description a local
habitation in the person of thy
neighbours, thou indulgest the disposition
thyself, and turnest my counsel
into food for thy propensity.&mdash;But I
have wandered from my original plan,
which was, to give some account of
our court of scandal, and of the decisions
which it pronounced.</p>

<p>The first cause that came before it,
was, a complaint from Julia Manners
against Miss Busy, who had circulated
a report that Julia was about to be
married.</p>

<p>Miss Busy lived opposite to Julia's
father's; and generally took her
morning and afternoon station at the
parlour window. She one day espied
from thence, a well dressed young
man escorting Julia home. Her curiosity
was immediately excited; and
she sallied out to the next neighbour's,
to inquire who the stranger
was, and to wonder if he was not a
suitor. The answer, <em>It is like enough</em>,
was sufficient. She continued her
walk, discovered his name at the next
place where she inquired, and received
some trivial confirmation of
her conjecture at a third. From that
time forward, she asked all whom
she visited, or received, if they had
seen Miss Manners' suitor. Conjecture
was built upon conjecture, till at
last poor Julia was to be married and
sent off in the space of a fortnight.
After a patient hearing of an hour,
the court decreed, that Miss Busy
should be interdicted any of our circle
for two weeks, and that her parlour
windows should be kept closed for
as many months.</p>

<p>Miss Lively happening to mention
at the tea table, one afternoon, that
Maria Harwood had jilted Captain
Jones, was immediately called to an
account. She blushed, and said it
was common rumour, and that she
knew nothing but what she had heard.
The court decided that this circumstance
would not excuse her, for that
she thus lent the authority of her
name to an idle story which she confessed
she had no reason to believe
was true. It was declared, that the
person who assisted in circulating
what was mere rumour, shared in the
guilt of the fabricator; and that as
Miss Lively was Maria Harwood's
particular friend, she had in this instance
doubly offended. Miss Lively
was therefore examined again as to
her authority for what she had said.
After much inquiry and prevarication,
it turned out, that her mother's
chamber-maid had heard Mr. Harwood's
cook say, that it would serve
such a proud thing right, if Miss
Maria would turn him off. The court
ordered the fair offender to be reprimanded.
The punishment had the
proper effect; and for six weeks
she could not mention an article of
doubtful intelligence, without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
asked if it came from Mr. Harwood's
cook.</p>

<p>The next cause which I recollect,
was of rather a more intricate nature.
Julia Manners and Emma Harwood
were near neighbours, and lived on
terms of close intimacy. Julia was
unconcealing, generous, and frank;
free in her expressions, and warm in
all her feelings. Emma was amiable
and correct, but jealous of her dignity;
and rather eager in listening to
the opinions of others respecting her.
Such a disposition always finds some
one ready to gratify it; and Emma
heard much to excite her jealousy,
and alarm her pride. A young lady,
<em>a mutual friend</em>, wondered to Emma
that she should be so intimate with
Miss Manners, and was sure she did
not know all that Julia said about her.
<em>What?</em> eagerly exclaimed Emma.
"She could not say: it was told in
confidence, and she did not like to
hurt any one's feelings." This only
excited more curiosity, and Emma
at last forced her half willing friend
to confess, that Julia had called her
proud and touchy; and said she did
not like her half so well as she did
her sister. Miss Harwood felt much
hurt; and behaved very coolly to her
old friend for several weeks. Julia at
last complained to the court, and the
affair was investigated. We found out,
upon examining the witnesses, that
Julia had only tacitly assented to these
opinions, which had been expressed
by the fair informer herself; and had
never suffered them to influence her
conduct. Emma was thereupon ordered
to kiss her old companion, and
make an acknowledgment before the
company of the injustice she had committed;
and we unanimously agreed
to banish their mutual friend from
our circle.</p>

<p>I had intended to give some further
decisions of our court, in which
the gentlemen are particularly interested;
but my good friends, the Editors,
are already looking askance for
the end of my paper. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In publica
commoda peccem</i>&mdash;if I longer take
up the room devoted to my worthy
neighbours, the farmers.</p>

<p>I shall only add, that we found our
court of scandal so efficacious, that it
restored our conversation in a few
weeks to its former tone, and entirely
banished the spirit of which I have
complained.</p>

<h2>"THE STORY OF RUTH."</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>"And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and
said unto the reapers, The Lord be with you. And
they answered him, The Lord bless thee."</p></blockquote>


<p>There are moments in the life of
every virtuous man, when the vices
and the enormities by which he is surrounded,
and above all, the glaring
deficiencies which he is compelled
to remark, even in those "whom he
hath delighted to honour," come back
upon the mind with an overpowering
force, and spread their disheartening
influence over the whole train of his
reflections. At such moments, when
we have turned with disgust from the
corruptions of human nature, and
have almost been tempted to seek in
"some boundless contiguity of shade,"
a retreat from their contaminating influence;
it is peculiarly delightful to
recur to some scene of virtuous enjoyment,
or to disperse the gloom
which has gathered around us by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
reference to the simplicity of other
times. While dwelling upon the records
of ancient purity, we become
conscious of a joyous complacency;
the mind is elated in the contemplation
of its own capability of happiness,
and reposes with delight upon the recollection
of those peaceful pleasures,
which can only exist among a virtuous
people.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no narrative to
be found among the works of ancient
or modern authors, upon which the
man who has become weary of the
follies of the world, can dwell with
more soothing sensations, than upon
the story of Ruth. It is not to the unrivalled
beauty of its style, nor to the
pathetic eloquence which it contains,
nor to the affecting nature of its incidents,
that it is indebted for its principal
attractions. But it is in the delineations
of the peculiar practices of
a people, who, as yet, had not forgotten
the characteristic simplicity of
their fathers; and in the striking allusions
to their habits of social intercourse,
that we feel ourselves most
deeply interested. Many have delighted
to paint the pleasures of rural
life in all their most glowing colours;
they have dilated upon its real and
its fancied enjoyments; and have laboured
to represent it as divested of
all that shall darken the lustre of native
purity, or detract from the reverence
of virtue. But it may well be
doubted whether they have ever presented
us with so engaging, and yet
so perfectly natural a picture, as that
which is to be found in the simple
and unlaboured narrative of inspiration.
In the very salutations between
Boaz and his reapers, we seem to
have an evidence of that happy equality,
and that habitual piety, which
are alike the concomitants of untainted
simplicity, and the victims of luxury
and corruption. "The Lord be
with you," was the address of "a
mighty man of wealth" to his reapers;
"and they answered him, The Lord
bless thee." These are doubtless to
be considered as the accustomed salutations
of the people; and they may
frequently have carried with them
nothing more than the idea of mere
ceremony. But they were salutations
which must have originated among a
religious people; and it was a ceremony
which must have been associated
with all that is helpless and dependant
in man, and all that is merciful
and omnipotent in his Creator.</p>

<p>Most of our readers will probably recollect
the amiable and enterprising <span class="smcap">Elizabeth
Fry</span>, who has been for some time
past, like the celebrated Howard, engaged
in visiting the prisons of England. The
peculiarity of the undertaking, for a female,
and her unexpected success in drawing
the attention of the wretched objects
of her care, to something like their native
dignity, have excited much interest in the
public mind. A copy of the following
letter, giving some account of her proceedings
in Glasgow, was handed to us,
with the privilege of publishing it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.</p>




<p class="center">
Communicated for the Rural Magazine.</p>

<h2><i>Letter to Mrs. Fletcher, from a<br />
friend in Glasgow.</i><br />
</h2>

<p>Mrs. Fry's manner and voice are
delightful; her communications, free
and unembarrassed.&mdash;She met, by
appointment, several of the magistrates,
Mr. Erving, and a number of
ladies, at Bridewell. She told them,
with much simplicity, what had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
done at Newgate; and proposed something
similar, if practicable, in Glasgow.</p>

<p>She entered into very pleasant conversation
with every one. All were
delighted when she offered to speak
a little to the poor women: but the
Keeper of Bridewell said he feared
it was a dangerous experiment; for
that they never, but by compulsion,
listened to reading, and were generally
disposed to turn all into ridicule.
She said she was not without fear of
this happening; but she thought it
would give pleasure to some, and
would serve to show the ladies what
she meant. The women, about a
hundred, were then assembled in a
large room; and when she went in,
seemed astonished, misdoubting, and
lowering. She took off her little
bonnet, and sat down on a low seat,
fronting the women; and looking
round with a kind and conciliating
manner, but with an eye that met
every one, she said&mdash;"I had better
just tell you what we are come
about." She said "she had had to do
with a great many poor women, sadly
wicked; more wicked than any
now present, and how they had recovered
from evil."</p>

<p>Her language was often Biblical,
always referring to our Saviour's promises,
and cheering with holy hope
those desolate beings. "Would you
like to turn from that which is wrong?
Would you like if ladies would visit
you, and speak comfort to you, and
help you to be better? Would you
tell them your griefs? for they who
have done wrong have many sorrows."</p>

<p>As she read them the rules, asking
them always if they approved, they
were to hold up their hands if they
acceeded. At first we saw them
down, and many hands were unraised;
but as she spoke, tears began
to fall. One beautiful girl near me,
had her eyes swimming in tears; and
her lips moved as if following Mrs.
Fry's. An older woman, who had
her Bible, we saw pressing upon it
involuntarily, as she became more
and more engrossed. The hands
were now almost all ready to rise at
every pause; and these callous and
obdurate offenders were, with one
consent, bowed before her. At this
moment, she took the Bible, and read
the parables of the <em>lost sheep</em>, and
the <em>pieces of silver</em>, and the <em>prodigal
son</em>.&mdash;It is not in my power to express
the effect of her saintly voice,
speaking such blessed words. She
often paused, and looked at the "poor
women," as she named them, with
such sweetness, as won all their confidence,
and she applied with a beauty
and taste such as I had never before
witnessed, the parts of the story&mdash;<em>His
father saw him when he was afar
off</em>, &amp;c.&mdash;A solemn pause succeeded
the reading. Then, resting the large
Bible on the ground, we saw her on
her knees before the women. Her
prayer was soothing and elevating;
and her musical voice, in the peculiar
recitative tone of her sect. I
felt it like a mother's song to a suffering
child.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="shorts">
<tr><td align="left">100 bushels of shorts, weighing 3500 lbs. neat, will cost</td><td align="right">D.30 00</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">Difference,</td><td align="right">D. 9 12</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here there is a difference of $9,
12 cents, in favour of shorts, in a
given weight of each; but I am quite
confident, in my own opinion, that,
taking an equal weight of each, there
is <em>double the sustenance</em> in the shorts;
and if this opinion be correct, it shows
the following important result:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="hay">
<tr><td align="left">7000 lbs. of hay, at 25 dls. per ton, would cost</td><td align="right">D.78 25</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">While 3500 lbs. of shorts, in which there is equal if not greater nutriment, would cost only</td><td align="right"><span class="bb">30 00</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Gain in favour of shorts,</td><td align="right">D.48 25</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>But it appears to me there is another
important saving would result to
the farmer, from the introduction of
mill feed. It would enable him to
keep his stock of horses at a great
deal less expense than he now keeps
them. They would be more healthy,
and <em>all his hay</em> might be saved for
the horned cattle. By a very slight
mixture of shorts with cut straw, or
cut corn-stalks, it would make very
palatable food; and the result in this
method, compared with foddering on
hay, would be as follows.</p>

<p>One hundred bushels of shorts
would be ample to mix with two tons
of straw, and two tons of stalks.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="straw">
<tr><td align="left">The shorts, as heretofore stated, would cost</td><td align="right">D.30 00</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2 tons of wheat, barley, or oat straw, at 5 dolls. per ton,</td><td align="right">10 00</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">The corn-stalks are now generally put in the barn-yard: allow what paid for hauling them, say D.2 50 per ton,</td><td align="right">5 00</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Allow also for trouble in cutting the straw and stalks,</td><td align="right"><span class="bb">10 00</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">55 00</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><i>The Weight of the foregoing as follows</i>, viz.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="weight">
<tr><td align="left">The shorts,</td><td align="right">3500</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="left">lbs.</td></tr>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="equal">
<tr><td align="left">An equal weight of hay, at the present price, 25 dolls. would cost</td><td align="right">139 25</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Difference,</td><td align="right"><span class="bt">D.84 25</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thou wilt readily perceive, without
my dwelling on it, that the above
method would answer equally well
for store cattle as for horses. By
the present mode the corn stalks are
almost wholly lost, and a great proportion
of the straw trodden under
foot in the barn-yards. One benefit
that would result from the change of
feeding, and which must be obvious
to every one, would be its enabling
every farmer to keep a larger stock;
and thus <em>increase his manure</em>,&mdash;the
grand secret, after all is said, in farming
well, and doing it to advantage.</p>

<p>If it is alleged that my calculation
of hay is too high, it may be observed,
that the shorts are also estimated at
a price higher than they often command
in the Philadelphia market. I
have known them as low as 20 cents;
and 25 cents is a very common price
in the fall of the year. They may
safely be put in bulk in the 11th mo.
and will keep sweet until the ensuing
spring.&mdash;I have thus hastily thrown
my ideas together on this subject.
If thou canst glean from them any
thing of importance, I shall be glad.</p>

<h2><i>Treatise on Agriculture</i>.</h2>


<h3>SECT. II.</h3>

<p>Of the actual state of Agriculture in Europe.</p>

<p>12. The climate and soil of <i>Great
Britain</i> and <i>Ireland</i>, are particularly
favourable to husbandry; nor is her
geographical position less auspicious&mdash;placed,
as she is, on the longest
line, and amidst the most important
markets of the continent of Europe.
If to these advantages be added the
laborious, enlightened, and enterprising
character of the nation, we cannot
but expect results the most favourable
to agriculture: yet is the fact
notoriously otherwise. To show that
this opinion is neither hasty nor unfounded,
we must enter into details,
which may not be unprofitable.</p>

<p>The surface of England is estimated
at 37,265,853 acres, which are distributed
as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="surface">
<tr><td align="left">In pasturage,</td><td align="right">18,796,45</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">In tillage,</td><td align="right">11,350,501</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">In cities, roads &amp; canals,</td><td align="right">3,454,740</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Lands fit for pasturage or tillage not cultivated,</td><td align="right">3,515,238</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Lands unfit for cultivation,</td><td align="right">2,148,921</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Of the arable land the following annual
disposition is made:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="arable">
<tr><td align="left">Lands unfit for cultivation,</td><td align="right">2,148,921</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">In wheat and rye,</td><td align="right">2,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">In peas, beans, and buckwheat,</td><td align="right">2,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">In barley and oats,</td><td align="right">4,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">In fallow, or in turnips or cabbages,</td><td align="right">3,400,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The lands, in wheat and rye, yield
on an average of ten years, <em>three
quarters</em> per acre, or 6,000,000 quarters;
yet there is an annual deficit in
England of 1,820,000 quarters, which
must be drawn from foreign markets.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>There is certainly nothing very flattering
in this view of English agriculture;
but it may be said to be one of
statists and politicians, and probably
underrated. Let us then see what
their own most eminent agriculturists,
their Young and Sinclair, and
Dickson and Marshall, say on this
subject&mdash;"<em>A very small portion of
the cultivated parts of Great Britain,
is to this day, submitted to a judicious
and well conducted system of husbandry;
not in fact more than four counties</em>,
(Norfolk, Sussex, Essex, and
Kent:) <em>while many large tracts of
excellent soil are managed in a way
the most imperfect and disadvantageous</em>."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Nor is her management of cattle
better. "Considering the domestic
animals in a general way, we find
each species, and almost every race,
capable of great improvement, and,
with a few exceptions, the sheep much
neglected. In some districts are
whole races of cattle incapable of
improvement (within a reasonable
time) in the three great objects which
they are expected to yield, viz. milk,
flesh, and labour."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> We now add
<em>some</em> of the causes to which this defective
husbandry has been ascribed:
"to enumerate all would be impossible,
from their number and complication."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>"1st. The <em>commons</em>, or unenclosed
grounds, which in many places
amount to near one half of the whole
arable land, and which are submitted
to the most absurd and ruinous system
of culture."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"2d. The <em>terms</em> (amounting to personal
servitude) under which many
of the lands are held."</p>

<p>"3d. The <em>shortness of leases</em> given
by corporations (civil and religious)
and by individuals, and which seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
exceed <em>three</em>, <em>five</em>, or <em>seven</em> years, excepting
in the counties of Norfolk,
Sussex, Essex, and Kent, where (with
great advantage to both landlord and
tenant) they are frequently extended
to twenty-one years."</p>

<p>"4th. The <em>tithes in kind</em>, paid by the
farmers to the church; a tax highly
vexatious in its character, and oppressive
in its effects: and</p>

<p>"5th. The <em>poor tax</em>, which has become
enormous, and of which the
yeomanry pay three fourths. Of this
tax it has been truly said, that it is a
powerful instrument of depopulation&mdash;a
barbarous contrivance for checking
all national industry."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>To these causes, assigned by British
writers, may be added the <em>increase</em>
of <em>population</em>, common to every nation
of Europe, and which in Great
Britain is beyond all proportion greater
than the progress of agriculture;
the <em>augmentation</em> of <em>cattle</em>, which occasions
that of pasturage, and the diminution
of tillage;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the <em>establishment</em>
of <i>great farms</i> at the expense
of <i>small</i> ones, and the <i>multiplication</i>
of <i>parks</i> and <i>pleasure grounds</i>; and
lastly, the <i>attraction of great cities</i>,
and the <i>continual drafts</i> made upon
the agricultural population, for the
army and navy, and for commerce
and manufactures.</p>




<h3>SECT. III.</h3>

<h4>Theory of Vegetation.</h4>


<p>Vegetables may be regarded as
the intermediate link in the great
chain of creation, between animals
and minerals. The latter grow by
mere chymical affinity, and by additions,
sometimes analogous and sometimes
foreign from their own nature;
while plants, like animals, have an organization
that enables them to receive
their food, digest and assimilate
it to their own substance, reproduce
their species, and maintain an existence
of longer or shorter duration.
Thus far the learned are agreed, but
at the next step they differ.</p>

<p>What is this food that gives to plants
their developement, and maturity, and
powers of reproduction? Lord Bacon
believed that <em>water</em> was the source
of vegetable life, and that the earth
was merely its home, its habitation,
serving to keep plants upright, and
to guard them against the extremes
of heat and cold. Tull, on the other
hand, (and after him Du Hamel) pronounced
<em>pulverized earth</em> the only
pabulum of plants, and on this opinion
built his system of husbandry.
Van Helmont and Boyle opposed this
doctrine by experiments: the former
planted and reared a cutting of willow
in a bed of dry earth, carefully weighed
and protected against accretion by
a tin plate, so perforated as to admit
only rain and distilled water, with
which it was occasionally moistened.
At the end of five years the plant
was found to have increased <em>one hundred
and sixty-four pounds</em>, and the
bed of earth to have lost, of its original
weight, only <em>two ounces</em>. Boyle
pursued a similar process with gourds,
and with a similar result. Notwithstanding
the apparent conclusiveness
of these experiments, their authority
was shaken, if not subverted, by others
made by Margraff, Bergman, Hales,
Kirwan, &amp;c. &amp;c. The first of these
showed, that the rain water employed
by Van Helmont, was itself charged
with saline and other earthy matter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Bergman demonstrated this by analysis,
while Kirwan and Hales proved
that the earth in which the willow
cutting was planted, could absorb
these matters through the pores of
the wooden box which contained it,
and that a glass case could alone have
prevented such absorption. Hunter,
finding that oil and salt entered into
the composition of plants, concluded
that these formed their principal food,
and accordingly recommended, as the
great desideratum in agriculture, an
<em>oil compost</em>. Lord Kaimes attempted
to revive the expiring creed of Lord
Bacon, but finding from Hales' statics,
that one third of the weight of a green
pea was made up of carbonic acid, he
added <em>air</em> to the watery aliment of the
English philosopher&mdash;but entirely rejected
<em>oil</em> and <em>earth</em>, as too gross to
enter the mouths of plants, and <em>salt</em>
as too acrid to afford them nourishment.
Quackery, which at one time
or other, has made its way into all
arts and sciences, could not easily be
excluded from agriculture. Hence
it was, that the Abbe de Valemont's
<em>prolific liquor</em>, and De Hare's and De
Vallier's <em>powders</em>, &amp;c. &amp;c. were believed
to be all that was necessary to
vegetation, and found the more advocates,
as they promised much and cost
little. But before the march of modern
chymistry, quackery could not
long maintain itself; and from the
labours of Bennet, Priestly, Saussure,
Ingenhouz, Sennebier, Schæder,
Chaptal, Davy, &amp;c. &amp;c. few doubts
remain on this important subject.&mdash;These
will be presented in the course
of the following inquiry.</p>

<p>1st. Of <em>earths</em>, and their relation to
vegetation.</p>

<p>Of six or eight substances, which
chymists have denominated <em>earths</em>,
four are widely and abundantly diffused,
and form the crust of our globe.
These are <em>silica</em>, <em>alumina</em>, <em>lime</em>, and
<em>magnesia</em>.&mdash;The first is the basis
of quartz, sand and gravel; the second,
of clay; the third, of bones, river
and marine shells, alabaster, marble,
limestone and chalk; and the
fourth, of that medicinal article known
by the name of calcined magnesia.&mdash;In
a pure or isolated state,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> these
earths are wholly unproductive; but
when decomposed and mixed,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and
to this mixture is added the residuum
of dead animal or vegetable matter,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
they become fertile, take the general
name of <em>soils</em>, and are again specially
denominated, after the earth that most
abounds in their compositions respectively.
If this be silica, they are called
<em>sandy</em>; if alumina, <em>argillaceous</em>;
if lime, <em>calcareous</em>; and if magnesia,
<em>magnesian</em>. Their properties are
well known: a <em>sandy</em> soil is loose,
easily moved, little retentive of moisture,
and subject to extreme dryness;
an <em>argillaceous</em> soil is hard and compact
when dry, tough and paste-like
when wet, greedy and tenacious of
moisture; turns up, when ploughed,
into massive clods, and admits the entrance
of roots with great difficulty.
A <em>calcareous</em> soil is dry, friable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
porous; water enters and leaves it
with facility; roots penetrate it without
difficulty, and (being already
greatly divided) less labour is necessary
for it than for clay. <em>Magnesian</em>,
like calcareous earth, is light, porous
and friable; but, like clay when wet,
takes the consistency of paste, and is
very tenaceous of water. It refuses
to combine with oxygen, or with the
alkalies; is generally found associated
with granite, gneiss, and schiste, and
is probably among the causes of their
comparative barrenness.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In these qualities are found the
<em>mechanical relations</em> between earths
and vegetables. To the divisibility of
the former it is owing, that the latter
are enabled to push their roots into
the earth; to their <em>density</em>, that plants
maintain themselves in an erect posture,
rise into the air, and resist the
action of the winds and rains; and to
their <em>power</em> of <em>absorbing</em> and <em>holding</em>
water, the advantage of a prolonged
application of moisture, necessary or
useful to vegetable life. But besides
performing these important offices,
there is reason to believe that they
contribute to the <em>food</em> of vegetables.
This opinion rests on the following
considerations and experiments:</p>

<p>1. If earths do not contribute directly
to the food of plants, then
would be all soils alike productive;
or in other words, if air and water <em>exclusively</em>
supply this food, then would
a soil of pure sand be as productive
as one of the richest alluvion.</p>

<p>2. Though plants may be made to
grow in pounded glass, or in metallic
oxides, yet is the growth, in these,
neither healthy nor vigorous; and,</p>

<p>3. All plants, on analysis, yield an
earthy product;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and this product is
found to partake most of the earth
that predominates in the soil producing
the analyzed plant; if <em>silica</em> be
the dominant earth, then is the product
obtained from the plant <em>silicious</em>;
if <em>lime</em> prevail, then is the product
<em>calcareous</em>, &amp;c. &amp;c. This important
fact is proved by De Saussure.</p>


<h4><i>1st Experiment.</i></h4>

<p>Two plants (the pinus abies) were
selected, the one from a calcareous,
the other from a granitic soil, the
ashes of which gave the following
products;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td align="left">Metallic oxides</td><td align="right">10 52</td><td align="right">00</td></tr>
</table></div>


<h4><i>2d Experiment.</i></h4>

<p>Two Rhododendrons were taken,
one from the calcareous soil of Mount
de la Salle, the other from the granitic
soils of Mount Bevern. Of a
<em>hundred</em> parts, the former gave fifty-seven
of carbonate of lime and five
of silica; the latter, thirty of carbonate
of lime, and fourteen of silica.</p>


<h4><i>3d Experiment.</i></h4>

<p>This was made to determine whether
vegetables, the product of a soil
having in it no silica, would, notwithstanding,
partake of that earth.&mdash;Plants
were accordingly taken from
Reculey de Thoiry, (a soil altogether
calcareous) and the result was a very
small portion of silica.</p>

<p>These experiments, says Chaptal,
leave little if any doubt, but that vegetables
derive the earthy matter they
contain from the soil in which they
grow.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>2. Of <em>water</em>, as an agent in vegetation.</p>

<p>Seeds placed in the earth, and in a
temperature above the freezing point,
and <em>watered</em>, will develope; that is,
their lobes<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> will swell, their roots descend
into the earth, and their stems
rise into the air. But without humidity,
they will not germinate; or deprived
of humidity after germinating,
they will perish. When germination
is complete, and the plant formed, its
roots and leaves are so organized as
to <em>absorb water</em>. The experiments
of Hales prove, that the weight of
plants is increased in wet and diminished
in dry weather; and that in the
latter, they draw from the atmosphere
(by means of their leaves)<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the moisture
necessary to their well being.&mdash;Du
Hamel (and after him Sennebier)
has shown, that the filaments that surround
the roots of plants, and which
has been called their hair, perform
for them in the <em>earth</em>, the office that
leaves perform in the atmosphere,
and that if deprived of these filaments
the plants die.</p>

<p>It would be easy, but useless, to
multiply facts of this kind tending to
establish a doctrine not contested, but
which after all does not assert, that
water makes part of the food of plants.
On this point two opinions exist&mdash;the
one, that this liquid is a solvent and
conductor of alimentary juices: the
other, that is itself an aliment and purveyor
of vegetable food at the same
time. The first opinion is abundantly
established. Water when charged
with oxygen, supplies to germinating
seeds the want of atmospheric air,
and saturated with animal or vegetable
matter in a state of decomposition,
or slightly impregnated with carbonic
acid, very perceptibly quickens and
invigorates vegetation. The second
opinion is favoured by some of De
Saussure's experiments. On these,
Chaptal makes the following remark,
which expresses very distinctly an
approbation of the doctrine they suggest:&mdash;"The
enormous quantity of
hydrogen (which makes so large a
part of vegetable matter) cannot be
accounted for but by admitting (in
the process of vegetation) the <em>decomposition</em>
of <em>water</em>, of which hydrogen
is the principal constituent; and that
though there is nothing in the present
state of our experience that directly
establishes this doctrine, yet that its
truth ought to be presumed, from the
analysis of plants and the necessary
and well-known action of water on
vegetation.</p>

<p class="center">
(To be continued.)<br />
</p>

<p><em>Correction.</em>&mdash;In copying the second section,
page 55, an error escaped in relation
to the <em>Tuscan</em> plough; the passage should
have read thus&mdash;"The plough of the north
of Europe, like that of this country, has
the power of a wedge, and acts horizontally&mdash;that
that of Tuscany has the same
direction, but very different form. With
the outline of a shovel, it consists of two
inclined planes, sloping from the centre,
and forms a gutter and two ridges.</p>

<h2>Review for the Rural Magazine.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging"><i>An Expose of the Causes of Intemperate
Drinking, and the means by which it may
be obviated. By Thomas Herttell of the
city of New York. Published by order
of the New York society for the promotion
of internal improvement</i>.&mdash;New York,
1819.&mdash;pp. 56.</p></blockquote>


<p>This is an ingenious and interesting
pamphlet. It is written with much
force and originality; and we think
we shall do the public a service by
laying before our readers some of the
author's remarks. There is no vice
which steals upon us in so many attractive
and deceitful shapes as that
of intemperate drinking. In this country
it is a national sin and infects
every class of society. We meet its
temptations in our social intercourse,
at our public festivals&mdash;in the resorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of business; we see it indulged in by
men of eminent character; spirituous
liquors are kept in every sideboard,
and brought forth upon almost every
occasion. One class of society imitates
the practice of another, and habitual
drunkenness has become the
stigma and disgrace of our country.</p>

<p>The pamphlet before us, remarks
(page 6) that "the existence of this
vice is now generally acknowledged,
its progress marked, and its effects
deplored. It is traced to the grog-shop
where many of its most degrading
<em>effects</em> are discovered, and <em>mis</em>taken
for <em>causes</em>, and the remedy attempted
to be applied."</p>

<p>"Though I am not disposed to become
the advocate of grog-shops, or
to avert from them any portion of merited
animadversion&mdash;or inclined to
become the apologist of those who,
under colour of keeping a tavern,
follow the business of dram-selling;
I am not willing that these places
should be considered either as the
<em>primary</em> or <em>principal cause</em> of the
evil under review. The current opinion
that such is the case, is incorrect,
as I shall endeavour to shew. And I
am induced to do this, from the conviction
that the mistake is calculated
to stop investigation short of the true
source, and thus prevent the remedies
from reaching the fountain-head
of the evil. It happens in this, as in
too many other instances, that the little
sinners become the subjects of
censure, while those whose crimes
differ from them only in magnitude,
are overlooked, or treated with complaisance.
Is it <em>wrong</em> to sell liquor
by the <em>glass</em>, to those who drink it&mdash;and
is it <em>not wrong to sell it by the
hogshead</em>, for the purpose of being so
disposed of? Are both these culpable,
and shall those who import and sell
it by the cargo, escape obloquy? And
does the distiller differ from all those,
in any other respect, than that he
makes while they sell the poison
for the purpose of its being drank?
It is not my intention to censure
the latter any more than the former
class of dealers in ardent drink;
and justice forbids that blame should
attach itself exclusively to either.
They are all <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">particepes criminis</i>, inasmuch
as they all contribute facilities
to the practice of intemperate
drinking, and thus aid the continuance
and increase of the evil. But its most
prolific sources are not to be found
among those classes of our fellow-citizens,
considered in the <em>business
character</em>. They only conform to the
<em>customs</em> and <em>habits</em> of the community
in which they live. They find
their neighbours in the practice of
using ardent drink, and profit by their
folly. No one would be so weak as
to invest his money in ardent liquor
with the expectation of <em>learning</em> people
to drink. It is the <em>already acquired
habit</em>, which constitutes the
basis of his calculations of profit. So
far, therefore, from grog-shops being
the <em>primary</em> or <em>principal cause</em> of intemperate
habits, the reverse of the
position approaches nearer the truth.
The habit of <em>intemperance is the cause
of grog-shops</em>.</p>

<p>"As the vice under consideration
did not originate at those places, it is
not limited to the class of people who
drink there. The customers of coffee
houses, hotels, and other taverns,
and the sideboards and wine-cellars of
private houses, prove the truth of this
position. The landlords of those establishments
would take it in dudgeon,
to be told that their customers
were of the lowest grade of society;
and the proprietors of well stored
sideboards and wine-cellars, would be
highly offended at the imputation of
drinking, or learning to drink, at grog-shops.
If the practice of tippling
was confined to the lower order of society,
it could not with any propriety
be regarded as a national sin. The
character and habits of that class of
the community can never alone constitute
national character. Admitting,
therefore, that intemperate drinking
is justly attributed to us as a feature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of our national character, it follows
irrefutably, that the <em>causes</em> which produce
that <em>effect</em> are not confined to the
purlieus of bar or tap-rooms. The
upper classes of society never follow
the examples of the lower: but the
latter do, as far as they are able, imitate
the customs of the former. Had
the habit of intemperance originated
in the lower class, it would not, in all
probability, have extended beyond it.
As its prevalence is so general as to
become a reproach to the nation, the
inference is conclusive, that it is the
progeny of higher parentage than
grog-shops."</p>

<p>"The radical sources of the evil"
says judge Herttell, "are <em>in the fashions,
customs, and examples, of what
are called the upper or wealthy classes
of the community</em>."</p>

<p>After remarking the common practice
that intoxicating liquors are universally
used as a table drink, he proceeds,
"Such being the practice, the
parents of a family must, of necessity,
adopt one of the two following
measures:&mdash;The children must be
permitted to partake of the common
table beverage, or they must not. In
the first case they are reared from
their childhood to the <em>habitual use of
ardent drink</em>. If the other course is
pursued, and the use of the liquor interdicted
to the children, while the
parents daily drink it in their presence,
he is very little acquainted
with human nature, who does not
know, that the value of the article is
thereby arbitrarily enhanced&mdash;the disposition
to enjoy it increased,&mdash;and,
that as soon as the restraints of the
parents are removed, and an opportunity
presents, the forbidden fruit
will be tasted, with as much avidity
as if both conscience and justice demanded
satisfaction for lost time and
pleasures. Under such circumstances,
how vain is it to hope that children
will not acquire the habit of intemperance&mdash;and
how weak is it to
wonder at their becoming drunkards!
Parents can hardly be said to have arrived
to years of discretion, who shall
expect that their admonitions against
intemperance will be heeded, while
their daily example is counteracting
their influence. How ridiculous is it
for them, while drinking wine and
brandy in the presence of their children,
to attempt to persuade them,
that it is not good for them! Should
it happen, that in a family of half a
dozen sons, there should be a sober
man, the merit is his, and not his parents';
nor are they to be pitied, except
for their folly, should they all be
drunkards; and such is frequently
the result. Thus, almost every family
becomes a school for intemperance,
and a nursery of customers for taverns
and grog-shops.</p>

<p>"Again; inebriating liquors have become
the medium <em>universally adopted
by society for manifesting friendship
and good will, one to another</em>. It
need only to be mentioned to be admitted,
that it is the common practice,
when friends or even strangers visit
each other, they have scarcely time after
being seated, to make the usual inquiries
about health, and the common
place remarks on the weather, before
they are invited to drink intoxicating liquors.
The welcome is deemed kind
and sincere, in proportion to the frequency,
and earnestness of the importunities
to drink&mdash;liberal in proportion
to the variety of the liquors;
and their richness and profusion add
to the other temptations to drink. Not
to offer them would be deemed unfriendly,
mean, or unmannerly. Not
to accept them, would be attributed
to ill-nature, or a want of politeness.
Hence, the visitor drinks to reciprocate
good will for the proffered kindness,
or in self-defence against the imputation
of ill-breeding. And the visited,
takes a glass for the company's
sake, as it is called; and to evince his
satisfaction on seeing his hospitality
accepted <em>in the spirit</em> in which it is
offered. In this way do the laws of
<em>fashion</em> and <em>custom constrain people
to drink</em>, who otherwise would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
no inclination, or who have acquired
that inclination, from the frequent if
not daily occasions which occur, for
tendering and reciprocating through
the customary channel, sentiments of
hospitality and good will to their associates,
friends, and strangers. <em>Thus
is the vice of intemperate drinking ingrafted
on the virtue of hospitality</em>;
and so long as that virtue is cherished,
and ardent liquors continue to be
tendered as evidence of its existence,
so long will the use of that article as
a drink continue, and the vice of intemperance
grow out of it. <em>This unnatural
blending of virtue and vice,
together with the practice of using inebriating
drink as a table beverage,
are the radical sources of that intemperance,
which is said to be "the crying
and increasing sin of the nation."</em>
It is at the family table, the first rudiments
of intemperance are taught;
the first examples set, and the first
essays at tippling attempted. The
practice is continued by the frequent
display of hospitality and politeness,
through the medium of ardent drink.
The <em>acquired habit</em>, shows itself on
holy-days, at dining and other parties,
and on all convivial occasions&mdash;is pursued
at taverns, and at last, descends
to, and terminates its career at grog-shops.
Look at the catalogue of family
misfortunes, and few will be
found to have escaped the direful disease
of intemperance; few which
have not had their prosperity and happiness
blighted by the extreme of that
vice, in some one or more of their
members." No doubt it is in the
opulent that many of the vices of society
originate. Their weaknesses
and errors are palliated; their example
imitated and their indulgences
eagerly craved by the poor. While
therefore, the general practice of
using ardent spirit continues among
them, our author reasons that the popular
remedy of curtailing the number
of grog-shops, though it would
lessen the <em>practice</em> would not <em>destroy</em>
the habit of intemperance. Should
there remain a solitary place where
liquor can be procured, the sin of intemperance
will continue to be committed,
and its associate vices and immorality
entailed on society.</p>

<p>"What!" says he, "it may be
asked by the reader, are we required
to relinquish the use of wine and ardent
spirits, in order to prevent their
abuse by others? Shall we deny ourselves
the <em>reasonable enjoyment</em> of
them, because others become <em>intemperate</em>?
Are we to be interdicted the
<em>moderate</em> use of them, because others
drink to excess and get drunk? As
well say the querists, might it be expected
that we should extract our
tongues, because others back-bite
their neighbours!</p>

<p>"In the first place, permit me to remark,
that I have not uttered a word
against the <em>moderate</em> or <em>reasonable</em>
use of ardent liquors. But before we
go farther, it may be proper to analyze
the terms, <em>moderation</em> and <em>intemperance</em>,
as they relate to the use of
inebriating drink. There can be no
objection to its <em>reasonable</em>, <em>necessary</em>,
and <em>moderate</em> use. But I do contend,
that the use of it by any person <em>in a
full state of health, is at all times unnecessary</em>.
The effect of strong drink,
is to excite the animal spirits to a preternatural
action.&mdash;When taken by a
person in full health, it raises the animal
spirits above the healthy standard.
This is <em>unnecessary</em>&mdash;and inasmuch
as it creates a deviation from a state
of real health, it produces <em>disease</em>,
and hence its use is <em>immoderate</em>, <em>intemperate</em>.
The <em>indirect debility</em>
which succeeds the exhausted stimulant,
is another and a worse state of
<em>disorder</em>, which goes to confirm the
truth, that the <em>first</em> draught of ardent
drink taken by those in full health, is
<em>unnecessary</em>, <em>unreasonable</em>, and <em>excessive</em>.
Nor is this all&mdash;this indirect
debility prompts a repetition of the
draught&mdash;and now the <em>practice</em> of
drinking has commenced. The animal
spirits having sunk as far below
as they have been raised above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
healthy standard, an <em>increased</em> quantity
is required to raise them as high
as before. Thus the habit of intemperance
<em>progresses</em>. The spirits, now
ebbing lower than before, demand increased
support, the yielding to which
demand, <em>confirms the habit of intemperance</em>.
But it unfortunately happens,
that the term <em>moderate</em>, when
applied to intoxicating drink, by those
who use it, is as unmeaning as the
word <em>enough</em> in the mouth of a miser,
when speaking of his money. Each
drinks according to his taste and
strength of habit, and calls it <em>moderate</em>.
Thus every grade of drinking,
from the single glass of the novice,
to the full bottle of the initiated, is
termed <em>moderate</em>. And every degree
of excitement, from <em>moderately merry</em>
to <em>moderately drunk</em>, is honoured
with the same name. The real truth
is, it is a poor apology for a bad practice;
and a <em>moderate</em> degree of reflection
would lead those not slaves to
the habit, to view it in that light."</p>

<p>"I have the authority of distinguished
physicians for remarking, that
next to <em>intemperate eating</em>, intemperate
<em>drinking</em> engenders more bodily
diseases, than any other single cause.
That <em>more die</em> of disorders occasioned
by drinking, <em>before they become
drunkards</em>, than <em>live to extend their
intemperance to that extreme</em>. That
the constant exercise of the labouring
class, <em>procrastinates</em>, while the
want of exercise tends to <em>facilitate</em> the
fatal effects of intemperance in the
other class of society&mdash;and hence it
is, that the <em>moderate drinking</em>, as it is
modestly termed, of the <em>latter</em>, destroys
at least as many as the <em>drunkenness
of the former</em>, and in that ratio
is as injurious to the community.
The reason these facts are not subjects
of general observation, is, that
when people who are not reputed
drunkards, die of complaints brought
on by drinking, their death is imputed
to the disorder, while that escapes
being attributed to its true cause&mdash;whereas,
reputed drunkards stand little
or no chance of dying by any other
means; for be they drowned by accident
or hanged for murder, their end
is generally, and perhaps too often,
correctly ascribed to intemperate
drinking."</p>

<p>"It is really wonderful to witness
how fertile is the love of ardent liquor,
in excuses and pretences for
its gratification. It is drank at one
time, <em>because the weather is warm</em>&mdash;at
another, <em>because it is cold</em>. It is
drank with enemies "to <em>reconcile
them</em>"&mdash;with friends, "<em>because they
don't meet every day</em>"&mdash;on all festive,
anniversary and other holydays, "<em>because
they only come once a year</em>."
And if at any or on all those times, the
bounds of <em>moderation</em> are exceeded,
it is allowed to be <em>excusable</em>, "<em>because
they are all extraordinary occasions!</em>"
Real or <em>pretended</em> disorders
are also often plead as an apology
for drinking ardent liquor; and
instances are not rare where, though
it may have been regularly prescribed
for medical purposes, and may
have cured the disorder, it has finally
killed the patient. It is doubtless for
this reason, that distinguished gentlemen
of the faculty have admitted,
that the internal use of ardent liquor,
even in cases in which it is indicated
as a medical remedy, is often productive
of far more hurt than good.</p>

<p>"The most common pretence, however,
is, that <em>the water is bad</em>, and requires
a <em>little spirits to qualify it</em>; and
hence it is infused with a poison of a
more deleterious quality than any it
naturally possessed. This <em>qualifying</em>
of the water, has been the means of
<em>disqualifying</em> many a valuable man,
for nearly every purpose, except to
bring disgrace, ruin, and misery on
himself, his family and connexions."</p>

<p>"I have taken no pains to ascertain
the authority by which retailers
of ardent drink are permitted to fix
stands and booths at the Park and
other places, on days of public parade
and festivity. The concentrating of
so many grog-shops at times and places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of the greatest collection of people,
tends rather to produce tumult
and confusion, than to preserve good
order. These places not only tempt
men to indulge to excess, but boys
are often seen in them following the
example&mdash;and it has been remarked,
that more of this youthful class are
seen disguised with liquor on those
days, than in all the year beside. Indeed,
it very rarely occurs that a boy
is seen thus degraded on any other
occasion. Should these travelling taverns
be permitted only on condition
that ardent spirits should not be carried
to them, or sold, or given gratis
there, it would remove the greatest
objection which can be urged against
them. The public would then be accommodated
with every necessary refreshment,
without jeopardizing their
peace by means of intemperate drinking.</p>

<p>"It would essentially benefit the
community, should the <em>inducements
to frequent taverns be lessened</em>. This
may be done in a variety of instances.
It is usual in the country towns, to
muster the militia at or in the immediate
vicinity of taverns. This practice
tends neither to improve the morality
or discipline of the men&mdash;and
if they must continue as now to be
mustered at those places or <em>not mustered
at all</em>, I have no hesitation in
saying, that the public would sustain
no material injury, should the latter
course be adopted; for it is certainly
true, and the reason is obvious, that
many of the men, at the close of their
exercise on those parade days, are
not so well qualified to serve their
country, as when they come to the
rendezvous. Much of the evil of the
present practice would be obviated,
should military officers, vested with
power to muster any corps of militia,
in the country towns, for the ordinary
purposes of exercise or inspection, be
bound by law to locate the parade
ground at least a mile from any tavern
or retail grocery. The carrying
of ardent liquor to the rendezvous,
and the selling it there, or giving
it gratis to any person, especially
the soldiers, should be interdicted, under
proper penalties, and provision
made for due execution of the law.
Other refreshments than ardent drink,
being as usual permitted, all the reasonable
conveniences of taverns would
be enjoyed, and many of those disgusting
instances of riot and disturbance,
occasioned by intemperate drinking,
and which often convert our militia
parades in the country, into scenes of
disorder and insubordination, rather
than schools for military instruction
and discipline, would be done away.</p>

<p>"The legislature should prohibit
justices' courts being held at taverns.
The disgraceful scenes which are too
often the consequences of trials at
those places, would thereby be prevented,
and the cause of <em>morality</em>, and
not unfrequently, that of <em>justice</em>, essentially
benefited. The same objection
lies, though perhaps not with
equal force, against sheriff's courts
being held at those places. If the
Court House is not at hand, it must
be a beggarly office which would not
afford the appropriating of a room for
the performance of its duties in the
dwelling of its incumbent, or pay for
the use of a convenient place elsewhere
for the purpose. The practice
of holding trials at taverns, before
referees, appointed by order of the
court, is not exempt from serious objections.&mdash;These,
however, being less
frequent, are not so productive of evil,
and, perhaps, are more difficult to be
obviated.</p>

<p>"The holding of auction sales at taverns,
as is frequently the case in the
country, is pregnant with mischief
sufficient to justify legislative interposition.&mdash;Those
who have witnessed,
can best describe them&mdash;I only know
them by description. On these occasions,
the number who go to buy, is
but small, compared to those who attend
from other motives. The owner
of the property for sale, is seldom
backward in circulating the glass freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
at his own expense, because he is
like to receive more than cent. per
cent. profit from the consequent indiscretion
of those who become affected
with the <em>spirit of bidding</em>. Many
are thus led on to buy unnecessarily
and dear; and frequent instances
occur, where people bid off more than
they have means to pay for&mdash;and
thence law-suits, trials, at taverns, family
distress, the insolvent act, and
perhaps poverty and pauperism close
the account. These are only the outlines
of the picture, which those who
have seen the original, are best qualified
to fill up with neglect of <em>domestic
concerns</em>&mdash;<em>horse-racing</em> and <em>jockeying</em>&mdash;<em>profane
swearing</em>&mdash;<em>drunkenness</em>&mdash;<em>quarrelling</em>,
and sometimes <em>fighting</em>,
and a variety of other <em>amusements</em>,
not unusual on such occasions.</p>

<p>"The lamentable consequences of
holding the polls of our political elections
at public houses, are too generally
known to require particular description.
Suffice it to say, that the
noise and tumult&mdash;the heated, irritating
and useless discussions which frequently
occur, and which go to impair
the respectability of the electors, and
the credit of the elective franchise, are
oftner the result of the <em>spirit of liquor</em>
than the <em>spirit of patriotism</em>. As far
as legislative provisions can obviate
the evil, it ought to be done. The expense
would be small and the benefit
great, should each ward in the cities,
and each town in the country, build
a house or room for the purpose of
elections. The profit which might
accrue from its use on other occasions,
would, in many instances, more
than pay the interest on its cost. It is
a little remarkable, that the sagacity
which prompted the interdiction of
military parades on the days of election,
as dangerous to the freedom of
the elective franchise, did not foresee
and guard against the evils consequent
on locating the election polls at
public houses.</p>

<p>"It is hoped that the good sense of
the community will operate to abolish
the custom of giving extravagant entertainments,
on any occasion, in honour
of distinguished characters. This
practice, by leading many to taverns,
and tempting them to indulge freely,
is productive of more mischief than
benefit to society. As an example,
it is bad. People, in the lower walks
of life, cannot be taught, that it is
wrong to get drunk in company with,
and out of mere good humour to their
friends, while they see too many of
the upper circles retire from those
feasts, not exactly sober. I humbly
conceive it would be manifesting far
higher respect for a great man, to
compliment him with a written address,
approbating his character and
conduct, accompanied with a medal,
a piece of plate, or other present, embellished
with appropriate insignia
and inscriptions.&mdash;These would be
lasting testimonials of character and
worth. Being always visible, they
would act continually as a stimuli to
urge others to emulate the honourable
course by which they were acquired;&mdash;whereas,
those public entertainments
are scarcely noticed beyond
the day they are <em>puffed</em> in the
newspapers&mdash;and if they were, the
honoured guest could derive no great
satisfaction in the reflection, that his
friends had <em>eaten</em> and <em>drank immoderately</em>,
in <em>honour of his virtues</em>. There
is a strong family likeness between
these dinners and those <em>eaten ex-officio</em>
by our city corporation.</p>

<p>"The meetings of self-created societies
at taverns, cannot, perhaps,
at all times, be well avoided. There
doubtless are many of those institutions
which are useful&mdash;but that there
are many which do more hurt than
good, is equally true. They ought,
indeed, to be productive of great
benefit, to counterbalance the evil tendency
they have, to draw their members
to taverns at night. Many a good
citizen has, in this way, unwarily contracted
irregular habits&mdash;and many a
deserving wife, and family of innocent
babes, have had reason to lament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the truth of this remark. It
will be a great pity, if those societies
cannot be prevailed on, to procure
places at which to hold their meetings.&mdash;This
might easily be effected,
unless too strong a predeliction for
tavern meetings should counteract so
reasonable a proposition."</p>

<p>"In the year 1740, Admiral Vernon
commanded the British fleet in the
West Indies. His undress coat was
made of <em>grogram</em>, a cloth fabricated
of silk and worsted. He was very
unpopular in the fleet, and the sailors,
in allusion to his coat, nick-named
him <em>Old Grogram</em>; and afterwards,
by way of shortening it, they called
him <em>Old Grog</em>. When ardent liquor
was first given to sailors, and until
the time above-mentioned, it was
drank <em>raw</em>&mdash;but being found to produce
many fatal bodily diseases, and
the naval service thereby much injured,
the Admiral directed that the
rum should be weakened with water.
The men were highly displeased at
having their drink thus <em>spoiled</em>, and
in derision of the admiral, called it by
his abbreviated nick-name, "<em>Grog.</em>"
This is the reason that rum, mixed
with water, bears that name. Let it
be observed, <em>because</em> the <em>raw</em> rum
was found to produce deleterious effects
on the health of the sailors, the
Admiral ordered that it should be
mixed with water. Now, as it probably
could not require many years
to make that discovery, it is fair to
conclude, that the first use of ardent
spirits, as a daily drink on ship-board,
could not have been a very great
length of time anterior to the year
1740."</p>

<p>"On another occasion, I have mentioned,
and will here repeat, that the
baleful practice of giving ardent liquor
to labourers, ought to be exploded.
This custom has so powerfully
aided other causes of intemperance,
that there is scarcely to be
found among the labouring class, any
who do not drink, and drink too
much. It is unquestionably owing,
in a great measure, to this, that
the apprentices to many mechanical
branches, are initiated into the habit
of intemperance, before they acquire
a knowledge of their trade; and it
is certainly owing to the same cause,
that many do not gain a perfect
knowledge of their business. Here,
too, we see a powerful objection operating,
to prevent many respectable
parents from putting their sons to mechanical
occupations. Hence, many
a promising mechanical genius is
smothered in the warehouse, or doomed
to add a useless member to the
already over-run and over-rated learned
professions. This serves to degrade
the honourable calling of mechanics,
which suffers another depression
from the necessity which
these circumstance create, of taking
apprentices from the lower circles of
society, whose want of the requisite
education disqualifies them for attaining
an adequate knowledge of their
trade. In addition to this, the master
mechanic, growing wealthy by
his business, too often becomes infected
with the follies and <em>fashions</em> of
upper life&mdash;in which sphere some
are fitted only to appear ridiculous.
Their sons, forsooth, must be <em>above</em>
their fathers' business. They must
be brought up gentlemen&mdash;and, of
course, reared in idleness and extravagance,
or become <em>professionable</em>
men or <em>merchants</em>.&mdash;Thus, by their
conduct, they give countenance to
those whose weakness may dispose
them to undervalue mechanical occupations.</p>

<p>"The great number of public holy-days
(as they are termed) which are
generally observed, are not without
their pernicious influence on the morals
of society.&mdash;Was the manner of
their celebration such as to honour
the events they are intended to commemorate,
their observance, if not
useful, would at least be innocent in
their consequences. But were we to
judge their objects solely by the manner
in which they are kept, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
effects they produce, we might be led
to the erroneous conclusion, that they
were instituted to subserve the causes
of vice and immorality. The general
suspension of useful employment on
those days, is followed by an increased
indulgence in drinking; and this
accounts for there being more crimes
committed on those days, than in any
other equal period of time. On the
authority of a gentleman who was on
the Grand Jury which sat in the present
year, I state, that far the greatest
portion of the business of that
Jury, grew out of crimes and disorders
committed during the Christmas
and New-Year holy-days. When it
is observed, that the court for the trial
of criminals is held once a month,
and crowded with business, it would
be superfluous to add arguments to
such facts.</p>

<p>"The custom of giving wine and
other liquors at funerals, is not at all
calculated to increase the solemnity
of those occasions. The practice is
bad, and ought to be discountenanced
by those whose example may influence
others to follow it. Instances
have happened, where the <em>effects</em> of
this <em>ill-timed hospitality</em>, have been
very justly lamented. How such an
absurd custom was first introduced,
is not, perhaps, so evident as the impropriety
of its continuance.</p>

<p>"To conclude&mdash;'To what purpose,'
an inconsiderate though well-intentioned
friend, has said, and others
as thoughtless, may say, 'do you attempt
to write down the use of ardent
drink? Notwithstanding all you have
said, or may say, people will continue
to drink as usual.' In the first place,
I answer, <em>I am not sure of that</em>&mdash;and
in the next place, <em>I am sure</em>, that if
they will continue to use spirituous
liquor as <em>a daily table drink</em>, and give
and receive it as the <em>token</em> of <em>friendship</em>
and <em>good will</em>, thereby associating
the <em>vice</em> of <em>drinking</em> with the <em>virtue</em>
of <em>hospitality</em>&mdash;if they will <em>accustom
their children to the use</em> or <em>witness</em>
the use of ardent drink, and rear them
in <em>idleness</em> and <em>extravagance</em>, with the
mistaken idea of thus making them <em>ladies</em>
and <em>gentlemen</em>&mdash;if they will continue
to 'have wine in their (public)
feasts,' and license taverns by thousands,
and create a thousand temptations
to frequent them&mdash;if they will
persist in the practice of giving strong
drink to the working class of society,
and <em>thereby contribute to degrade their
character, and bring useful industry</em>
into contempt&mdash;if they will continue
to celebrate their anniversaries by a
course of unrestrained intemperance&mdash;then,
I again repeat, <em>I am sure</em>, that
notwithstanding all their professions of
patriotism, morality, philanthropy and
religion, they cannot escape the imputation
of loving ardent spirits more
than the work of reformation: and
moreover, cannot avert, and will merit
all the ills which are flowing, and
must continue to flow, from the demoralizing
influence of intoxicating
drink. Intemperance, the reigning sin
of the nation, will go on 'increasing
to increase,' till immorality, spreading
far and wide, shall debase the people,
corrupt their rulers, and destroy
the liberties of our country. Then
dark illimited despotism, with its
genial concomitant, blind superstition,
weak-minded bigotry, and black-hearted
fanaticism; while forging the
chains, preparing the wheel, and igniting
the faggots of unholy and merciless
persecution, will rear its head,
and impiously exult in the downfall of
the only government on earth, the
existence of which, is not a reproach
to the common sense of mankind."</p>

<h2><i>A view of Botany Bay.</i></h2>


<p>In the 63d number of the Edinburgh
Review, for July last, we find
an interesting account of the settlement
called Botany Bay in New
South Wales, discovered by the Dutch
in 1616, and taken possession of by
the British in 1770. On the close of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the war by which the United States
obtained their independence, the government
of Great Britain, at a loss
for a receptacle for convicts sentenced
to banishment, at last selected
this remote country, and made the
first settlement there in 1778. This
colony, now a very flourishing one,
was thus planted with the rogues of
England, Ireland and Scotland, sent
thither, in exile, as a punishment for
their crimes&mdash;transportation to that
distant and savage land being more
dreaded there, perhaps, than our
penitentiary is here, from which escapes
are made with so much facility&mdash;the
<em>certainty</em> of punishment deterring
from the commission of crime
more than its <em>severity</em>. The criminals
landed in this southern clime,
finding themselves placed in a new
situation, where little could be got by
theft, and having a better chance than
in the mother country of earning a
comfortable subsistence, often changed
their habits, and became industrious,
if not honest men. They are
probably destined to be a great nation,
having an abundant scope of territory,
2,700 miles in length, and
2,000 in breadth, (three-fourths the
extent of Europe,) and will, at a future
day, in imitation of America, cast off
the shackles of colonial subjection,
and assert the prerogative of self-government.</p>

<p>The climate of Botany Bay is represented
to be equal to any in Europe,
but rather Asiatic than European&mdash;Favourable
on the whole to
health and longevity. December,
January, and February, are the summer
months of that country, and
then the heat, which at noon is at 80
deg. is tempered by a strong sea-breeze.
The winter months, June,
July, and August, have very cold
nights, and fire through the day is
comfortable.</p>

<p>The Reviewer humorously calls
this colony "a land of convicts and
kangaroos," and sportively observes,
that, "in this remote part of the earth
Nature (having made horses, oxen,
ducks, geese, oaks, elms, and all regular
and useful productions, for the
rest of the world) seems determined
to have a bit of play, and to amuse
herself as she pleases. Accordingly,
she makes cherries with the stone on
the outside; and a monstrous animal,
as tall as a granadier, with the head
of a rabbit, a tail as big as a bed-post,
hopping at the rate of five hops to a
mile, with three or four young kangaroos
looking out of its false uterus to
see what is passing. Then comes a
quadruped as big as a large cat, with
the eyes, colour, and skin of a mole,
and the bill and web-feet of a duck&mdash;'puzzling
Dr. Shaw' and rendering
the latter half of his life miserable,
from his utter inability to determine
whether it was a bird or a beast.
Add to this a parrot, with the legs of
a sea-gull; a skate with the head of
a shark, and a bird of such monstrous
dimensions that a side bone of it will
dine three real carnivorous Englishmen;
together with many other productions
that agitate Sir Joseph, and
fill him with mingled emotions of
distress and delight."</p>

<p>Sydney, the principal town and
seat of government, has a population
of 7000 souls; it has a newspaper, a
bank, and many public and private
buildings, that would not disgrace
the best parts of London&mdash;So says
Mr. Wentworth, a native of Botany
Bay, who has lately published a statistical,
historical, and political description
of the country.</p>

<p>The attention paid to the education
of the children, by their "larcenous
forefathers," is worthy of commendation
and of imitation in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
parts of the world, where the morals
of the parent stock are less depraved.
"The town of Sydney contains
2 good public schools, for the education
of 224 children of both sexes.
There are establishments also for the
diffusion of education in every populous
district throughout the colony: the
masters of these schools are allowed
stipulated salaries from the Orphans'
fund. Mr. Wentworth states, that
one-eighth part of the whole revenue
of the colony is appropriated to the
purposes of education: this eighth
he computes at 2500<i>l.</i> Independent
of these institutions, there is an Auxiliary
Bible Society, a Sunday School,
and several good private schools.
This is all as it should he: The education
of the poor, important every
where, is indispensable at Botany
Bay. Nothing but the earliest attention
to the habits of children can
restrain the erratic finger from the
contiguous scrip, to prevent the hereditary
tendency of larcenous abstraction.
The American arrangements
respecting the education of
the lower orders, is excellent. Their
unsold lands are surveyed, and divided
into districts. In the centre of
every district, an ample and well selected
lot is provided for the support
of future schools. We wish this had
been imitated in New Holland; for
we are of opinion that the elevated
nobleman, Lord Sidmouth, should intimate
what is good and wise, even
if the Americans are his teachers.
Mr. Wentworth talks of 15,000 acres
set apart for the support of the
Female Orphan schools; which certainly
does sound a little extravagant;
but then 50 or 100 acres of
this reserve are given as a portion to
each female orphan; so that all this
pious tract of ground will be soon
married away. This donation of
women, in a place where they are
scarce, is amiable and foolish enough.
There is a school also for the education
and civilization of the natives, we
hope not to the exclusion of the children
of convicts, who have clearly a
prior claim upon public charity."</p>

<p>Great exertions have been made in
public roads and bridges. Toll gates
have been established on all the principal
roads. The general average
of unimproved land in the neighbourhood
of the town is 5<i>l.</i> sterling
per acre. The inhabitants of New
South Wales have suffered greatly
from the tyranny and caprice of the
rulers placed over them by Britain.
There is no sufficient check on the
Governor of the colony&mdash;far from
the parent country, there is no Council
to restrain his excesses, nor any
Colonial Legislature to assert the
rights of the people. There is no
trial by jury. The Governor imposes
what taxes he pleases.</p>

<h2>INTELLIGENCE.</h2>


<p>Died, at Windsor Castle, George
William Frederic Guelph on the 29th
of January.</p>

<p>His Majesty George the Third,
was born on the 24th of May, 1738,
which since the alteration of the style,
has become the 4th of June. At his
death, therefore, he had reached the
advanced age of eighty-one years seven
months and twenty-six days. He
was proclaimed king on the 25th of
October, 1760.&mdash;On September 8th,
1761, he was married to her late majesty,
and had issue seven sons and
five daughters, of whom six of the
former and four of the latter survive
him. His royal highness the Prince
of Wales was appointed Regent on
the 6th of Feb. 1811, and from that
time he has been virtual sovereign,
acting in the name and on the behalf
of his majesty. His majesty, from the
appointment of the Regent, remained
in retirement at Windsor Castle,
under the guardianship of a council,
who met every month, or more frequently
as occasions might require,
and issued a report of the state of his
indisposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>After the death of his late majesty
had been formally announced, the following
instrument was prepared and
signed.</p>

<p>"Whereas, it hath pleased the Almighty
God, to call to his mercy our
late sovereign lord, king George the
3d. of blessed memory, by whose decease
the imperial crown of the united
kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,
is solely and rightfully come to
the high and mighty prince, George
prince of Wales: We, therefore, the
lords spiritual and temporal of this
realm, being here assisted with those
of his late majesty's privy council,
with numbers of other principal gentlemen
of quality, with the lord mayor,
aldermen and citizens of London,
do now hereby, with one voice and
consent, of tongue and heart, publish
and proclaim, that the high and
mighty prince, George, prince of
Wales, is now, by the death of the
late sovereign, of happy memory, become
our only lawful and rightful
liege, lord George the 4th. by the
grace of God, king of Great Britain
and Ireland, defender of the faith, &amp;c.
to whom we do acknowledge all faith
and constant obedience, with all
hearty and humble affection; beseeching
God, by whom kings and queens
do reign, to bless the royal prince,
George the 4th with long and happy
years, to reign over us.</p>

<p>Given at the court at Carlton-house,
this 30th day of January, 1820.</p>

<p class="center">
GOD SAVE THE KING."<br />
</p>

<p>Then follows the signature of the
Privy councillors, &amp;c. present.</p>

<p>The king's fourth son, Edward
Guelph, duke of Kent, &amp;c. died at
Sidmouth, after a short but very severe
illness on the 23d of January.
He was born November 2, 1767.</p>

<p>The interment of the king of England,
took place on the 16th of February;
and on the following day, both
houses of parliament convened according
to adjournment. A message
from the new king was received and
read, and <em>an address of condolence</em>
<em>and congratulation</em> was adopted in the
house of lords.</p>

<p>A new parliament is to be summoned;
and great activity every
where prevails in preparing for the
approaching general election.</p>

<p><i>Ancient Custom.</i>&mdash;On the day that
the present King was to be proclaimed
as George the Fourth, a procession
was formed fronting the Palace
of Carlton-house, and proceeded for
the city, when, on the cavalcade arriving
at Temple-bar they found the
gates, according to ancient custom,
closed. "The City Marshall was
sent forward to the gate, intimation
having been given to the lord Mayor
that there was a loud knocking at
the gate, and a demand of admittance
from some persons outside. The
Marshall went to the gate, and asked,
'Who knocks,' and was answered,
'The Herald King at Arms. I attend
with a warrant to proclaim King
George the Fourth. Open your
gates.' The City Marshall answered,
'I shall inform the Lord Mayor
that you are waiting at the gate.' The
Marshall then rode back to the Lord
Mayor, and having informed him that
the Herald King at Arms was in
waiting for admission, to proclaim
George the Fourth, King of England,
was directed by his Lordship to give
the admission required, which was to
be limited to the Herald King at
Arms. The Marshall upon going to
the gates, said to the officers, 'Open
one side of the gates and admit the
Herald King at Arms, and him alone.'
The Herald then rode in, supported
by his guards, and was accompanied
by the City Marshall to the Lord
Mayor. The Herald King at Arms
presented the warrant.&mdash;The Lord
Mayor immediately said, 'admit the
whole procession into our city of London.'"</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Heard, the Garter-King-at-Arms,
is 90 years of age.</p>

<p>George the 4th was proclaimed as
King, at Liverpool, without parade,
on the 31st of Jan. but was proclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
there again on the 19th of Feb.
with much pomp and ceremony.&mdash;There
was a grand military and civil
procession; and among the latter, all
the mechanic professions, each with
appropriate standards.</p>

<p>The late King is said to have given
between 60 and $70,000 a year in
charities.</p>

<i>London</i>, Feb. 18.<br />
</p>

<p>We have received this morning
the Paris papers of Tuesday. They
are, of course, painfully interesting,
for they communicate a variety of
facts connected with the assassination
of his Royal Highness the Duke de
Berri. Among the most important
of these is the undeniable one, that
the atrocious crime was committed
from political motives. This alarming
truth was distinctly admitted, not
only by the Members of the two
Chambers, who met to address his
Majesty, upon the mournful occasion
but it is recognized by the King himself,
in the concluding sentence of his
answer to the Address of the Deputies.&mdash;"The
Chamber cannot doubt,"
said his Majesty, "that, feeling as a
man, and acting as a king, I shall
adopt every necessary measure to
preserve the <em>State from dangers, of
which I am but too forcibly forewarned
by the crime of this day</em>." The
assassin himself, indeed, according to
the letter of our private correspondent,
upon being interrogated, avowed
that he had exterminated the
Duke, as the youngest of the Royal
Family, "knowing that nature would
soon relieve him from the necessity
of abridging the days of the King."</p>

<p>The Duke of Berri was in his 42d
year, and was, next to his aged father,
Count d'Artois, heir to the throne.</p>

<p>"The assassin is about 30 years of
age; his name is Louvel. It appears
he was one of those who went and returned
with Bonaparte from Elba,
and has since been employed, up to
the very time of the fatal deed, in his
Majesty's hunting establishment.</p>

<p>A vessel has arrived at Portsmouth
from St. Helena, which place she left
on the 10th of December. Bonaparte,
at that time, was well, and continued
his out-door exercise, in the grounds
attached to Longwood. "His new
house was nearly ready for his reception,
and it is in every respect a most
spacious and commodious mansion;
containing, with a ball room, 17 excellent
rooms."</p>

<h2>MISCELLANY.</h2>


<p>From a late report of the Secretary
of the Treasury it appears that
the banking capital of the United
States, including the United States'
bank, and excluding all banks incorporated
since 1817, amounts to
$125,000,000.</p>

<p>A curious circumstance occurred
on Monday week at Market Levington,
Wilts. A person named Jane
Webb attended divine service attired
precisely in the same suit of mourning
for our late sovereign George III.
as was worn by her for king George
II. The singularity of its make, attracted
much notice. This venerable
and frugal spinster has attained
her 76th year.</p>

<p>An oil spring has been discovered
in the county of Morgan, Ohio, which
is stated to yield an inexhaustible
quantity of this liquid. It sells for
fifty cents a gallon. It is used for
lamps, for currying leather, for mixing
in medicines, &amp;c. Whether it is
calculated for mixing in paints had
not been ascertained.</p>

<p><i>Worm in a Horse's eye.</i>&mdash;Dr. William
Scott, of Madras, has extracted
a worm from the aqueous humour of
a horse's eye to which he gave the
name of <i>Accaris pellucidus</i>.</p>

<p>The legislature of New Jersey has
passed a law for incorporating a company
for the purpose of embanking
and draining the salt marsh on Barbadoes
neck in that state.</p>

<p>In the British Quarterly Review,
mention is made of a British statute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
now in force, in which the punishment
of a certain offence is <em>transportation</em>
for 14 years; and on conviction,
one half thereof is to go to
the <em>informer</em>, and the other half to
the <em>king</em>! Did ever an Irish parliament
make such a blunder as this?</p>

<p><i>Virginia</i> is much engaged in laying
out works of internal improvement;
especially with a project of
uniting the waters of James river with
those of Kenawha.</p>

<p><i>The Bordeaux ship of discovery</i>,
(says a New York paper) has arrived
at Bordeaux, after an absence of
three years and a half. This ship has
traversed the Pacific Ocean, and collected
at the Sandwich Islands, some
interesting accounts of the fate of <i>La
Peyrouse</i> and his companions. A London
paper states, that the account
will soon be published.</p>

<p>The Maine and Missouri questions
are at length settled. Both districts of
country are admitted into the Union,
as states; the former, from its population,
requiring no restriction of slavery;
and the latter admitted on the
same terms&mdash;4 majority in the house
of representatives in favour of the
bill as it has passed. The bill, however,
excludes slavery from all the
territory North of 36<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> deg. of N. latitude,
Missouri excepted.</p>

<p>From a respectable correspondent
in Pauling, Duchess county, we have
the following singular case. Mr. Luther
Brownwell of Beekman, in that
county having, in the month of April
1815, a sow with a litter of five pigs,
and she dying when they were only
two days old, he appropriated the
milk of one of his new milch cows
for their support. The cow was milked
four or five times a day for this purpose,
and the pigs were learned to
drink the milk. When pasturing time
came, they were put in the field where
the cow with nine others was kept.
At the age of two months, the pigs
had the sagacity to single out this cow
from the rest, and when hungry would
come round her, root at her legs,
squeak, and exhibit the usual signs
of their wants. The cow at length
learned to lay down, and let them
suck what they wanted. In this way
they grew very rapidly until some time
in September, when they were put
up to fatten, and were killed the November
following. Their average
weight was <i>240lbs.</i> or <i>1200lbs.</i> of
pork, which he sold for $8,50 a hundred.</p>

<p>Aside from the singularity of this
case, the inquiry naturally presents
itself, could the milk of the cow have
been put to a more profitable use?
Is it not probable that her milk made
an addition of at least <i>600lbs.</i> to the
quantity of pork? [<i>Plough Boy.</i></p>

<p>An apprentices' library is about to
be established in New York, on the
same plan as the one in this city and
in Boston. The library in Boston consists
of about 1000 volumes, principally
of books on the mechanic arts,
of history, travels, and other useful
knowledge, and on moral and religious
subjects.</p>

<p><i>Steam Boats.</i>&mdash;Among many interesting
articles in the second number
of the German Correspondent, published
in New York, we find the following:</p>

<p>"The steam boat Blucher was lately
launched at Potsdam. Several members
of the royal family were present,
and Prince Albseeth conferred the
name. This is probably the largest
steam boat in Europe, the whole
length being 200 feet. It draws but
20<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> inches of water. The boat contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
<em>two</em> engines, which perform exceedingly
well. The utmost precaution
is used against accidents by fire.
As this vessel will carry merchandize
of great value, and in large quantities,
the hold has been divided into nine
compartments by water proof partitions,
so that, in case it should spring
a leak, there is every probability that
the vessel would not fill&mdash;besides, by
means of tubes there is a communication
between these chambers and
the locations of the engines, which
are so arranged as to pump any quantity
of water out of the divisions where
the leak may exist. This improvement
appears to be well calculated for
the steam boats on the Mississippi."</p>

<p><i>Sagacity of a bear.</i>&mdash;A bear which
had stolen a sheep, being closely persued
by several dogs, promptly resorted
to a most ingenious expedient.
He tore the sheep in pieces, and
threw the dogs one of the hinder
legs; and while they were partaking
of this repast, had full time to escape.</p>

<p>This fact is formally certified, by a
game-keeper in Transylvania, where
there are a great many bears. The
most remarkable circumstance was,
that from that time the dogs would
never attack any of these animals,
but on the contrary, received them
in the most friendly manner, as if
they expected a dinner. The owner
of the flock was obliged to have the
dogs shot, that he might not have
those hungry guests always about
him.     [<i>German Paper.</i></p>

<h2>PHENOMENON.</h2>

<p class="center">
<i>To the Editor of the Literary Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>I lately read an account of the
figure, which, under some peculiar
state of the atmosphere, appears on
the Hartz mountain, in Germany.
It reminds me of an extraordinary
illusion to which I was once exposed;
if it have interest enough for
publication, it is at your service.
About seven years since, I was one
evening, in the month of October,
returning late from a friend's house
in the country, where I had dined, to
the neighbouring town, about a mile
distant: the night was exceedingly
dark, and I had been requested to
take with me a lantern; a pocket
one could not be found, and I was
provided with that which the servants
generally carried swung in the
hand. I had to pass through some
fields over high ground: soon after
I had entered the second of these,
I observed something large moving
along with me. I placed the lantern
on the ground, and walking toward
it, saw a gigantic figure retiring
with astonishing speed. I immediately
perceived it was my own
shadow on a fog, which I had not before
observed. The appearance of
retiring was phantasmagoric, and
arose from my interruption of the
rays of light from the lantern, at a
lesser angle, as my distance from the
light increased. My return to the
light was terrific; the figure appeared
to advance upon me with frightful
rapidity, till it seemed forty feet
high. If I had been ignorant of the
cause of this appearance, the effects
might have much alarmed me, and
led to my telling such stories as I
should not have gained credit by relating:
but aware of the cause, I
was delighted with the singularity of
my situation; and might have been
thought mad by an observer, for
every fantastic attitude and action I
could assume I did, to be mimicked
by my new and shadowy acquaintance.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p><i>English vegetables.</i>&mdash;In the former
part of the reign of king Henry
VIII. there did not grow in England
a cabbage, carrot, turnip, or other
edible root&mdash;and even Queen Catherine
could not command a sallad
for dinner, till the king brought over
a gardener from the Netherlands.&mdash;The
artichoke, apricot, and damask
rose, then made their first appearance
in England.</p>


<p><i>Coaches.</i>&mdash;Coaches were introduced
in 1585; before which time,
Queen Elizabeth rode, on public occasions,
behind her Lord Chamberlain.</p>


<p><i>Ladies' Charity.</i>&mdash;In the letters
of Madame D. upon England, which
have just been published, we find
the following passage, which shows
how little a woman used to the coteries
of Paris can appreciate the
purest of our Christian charities.&mdash;"The
most elegant women in London
have a certain day, upon which
they go to a large room surrounded
with counters, at the end of Argyle
Street; they go in person, to sell,
for the profit of the poor, the trifles,
which they amuse themselves in making
during the course of the year.
You may imagine that a young gentleman
who pays his court to a young
lady, is not permitted to hesitate at
the price of the work of her fair
hands. In fact, I saw several who
were really foolishly extravagant, and
the bank-notes were showered down
on the counters of these ladies.</p>

<p>"I observed in this assembly the
prettiest young women I ever saw in
my life; all the men loiter delighted
before her counter, and it was she
whose stock was the soonest disposed
of.</p>

<p>The last man who stopped at it
took a handful of bank-notes, and exchanged
them for a watch-ribbon. I
departed, enchanted with this scene."</p>


<p><i>Chimnies.</i>&mdash;In the age next preceding
Queen Elizabeth, there were
few chimnies, even in capital towns:
the fire was laid to the wall, and the
smoke issued at the roof, or door, or
window. The houses were wattled,
and plastered over with clay; and all
the furniture and utensils were of
wood. The people slept on straw pallets,
with a log of wood for a pillow.</p>


<p>"<i>The wisdom of Catwg</i>&mdash;The
seven questions proposed by Catwg
the wise to seven wise men in his
college at Llanfeithin, with their answers.</p>

<p>"1. What constitutes supreme
goodness in a man? Equity.</p>

<p>"2 What shews transcendent wisdom
in a man? To refrain from
injuring another when he has the
ability.</p>

<p>"3. What is the most headstrong
vice in a man? Incontinence.</p>

<p>"4. Who is the poorest man?
He who has not resolution to take of
his own.</p>

<p>"5. Who is the richest man? He
who coveteth nothing belonging to
another.</p>

<p>"6. What is the fairest quality in
a man? Sincerity.</p>

<p>"7. What is the greatest folly in
a man? The wish to injure another
without having the power to effect it."</p>


<p><i>Antediluvian oak.</i>&mdash;In digging the
capacious drain in Bilsby parish, connected
with the new work of sewers
near Alford, at the depth of thirty
feet some oak trees have been found,
which are at this time the subject of
examination by the curious. They
are as black as ebony, but the heart
is firm wood, notwithstanding the
trees are believed to have been deposited
for several thousand years.
The conjecture formed by those best
qualified for considering the subject of
similar discoveries in other situations
is, that they existed before Noah's
flood.</p>


<p><i>Nugæ Antiquæ.</i>&mdash;From a household
book of the Earl of Northumberland
in the reign of Henry VIII.
it appears, that his family, during
winter, fed mostly on salt fish and
salt meat, and with that view there
was an appointment of 160 gallons of
mustard. The Earl had two cooks,
and more than 200 domestics.</p>

<p>Holinshed says, that merchants,
when they gave a feast, rejected
butchers' meat as unworthy of their
table: having jellies of all colours,
and in all figures, representing flowers,
trees, beasts, fish, fowl and fruit.</p>

<p>The streets of Paris, not being
paved, was covered with mud; and
yet for a woman to travel those streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in a cart was held an article of luxury,
and prohibited by Philip the Fair.</p>

<p>An old tenure in England binds
the vassal to find straw for the King's
bed, and hay for his horse.</p>

<p>It was a luxurious change of wood
platters for pewter plates, and from
wooden spoons to those of tin.</p>

<p>Holinshed says, "when our houses
were built of willow, then had we
oaken men? but now that our houses
are made of oak, our men are not only
become willow but, many, through
Persian delicacy, crept in among us,
altogether of straw, which is a sore
alteration."</p>


<p><i>Reproof.</i>&mdash;A person was remonstrating
with a friend, inclined too
much to dandyism, on the absurdity
of following such foppish fashions.
"They are really contemptible, (said
he,) and I am sure all who see you
must think you ridiculous." "I don't
value the opinion of the world, (answered
he,) I laugh at all those who
think me ridiculous." "Then you
can never give over laughing," drily
observed his mentor.</p>


<p><i>Anecdote.</i>&mdash;When the English
Court interfered in favour of the protestant
subjects of Louis XIV. and
requested his majesty to release some
who had been sent to the gallies,
the king asked angrily, "What would
the king of Great Britain say were
I to demand the prisoners of Newgate
from him?" Sir, (replied the
ambassador,) my master would give
every one of them up to your majesty,
if, as we do, <em>you reclaim them
as brothers</em>.</p>

"A guilty conscience needs no accuser."<br />
</p>

<p>A singular instance of the truth of
this saying occurred a few days ago,
in Market Street. A sharper, under
pretence of buying some small article
in a store, managed to take from
a countryman present, his pocket
book, and having secured, as he supposed,
his booty, paid his little bill
and retired. The honest storekeeper
discovering he had given him too
little change, immediately went to
the door and called him to stop.
The fellow supposing himself detected,
took, to his heels. The croud
in the street observing the circumstances
cried stop thief! stop thief!
He was soon overtaken and brought
back, when the pocket book, which
had not been missed by the owner,
was found on him, and he taken before
the proper authority.</p>

<h2><i>A Newly discovered, cheap and
durable Paint.</i></h2>


<p>I send you for publication in the
Rural Magazine, a receipt for a newly
discovered paint, it is cheap and
will no doubt be useful to some of
your readers.</p>

<p class="sig">D.</p>

<p>To a common 3 gallon pail of
whitewash, add 1 pint of cheap molasses
and 1 pint of white table salt.
The best store lime should be selected
and boiling water used in
slaking it. It should be frequently
stirred as you put it on. Two thin
coats will be sufficient to cover the
weatherboards of out-buildings. It
will not wash or scale off like common
whitewash and is beautifully
white. For other colours mix ochres
of various kinds.</p>


<p><i>Air Jacket.</i>&mdash;Mr. Charles Kendal
lately made an experiment on the
Thames, of the efficacy of his jacket,
or Life-preserver, which completely
succeeded. He went from the
southwark Bridge through London
Bridge with great ease and on to the
London Docks in 20 minutes, walking
upright in the water accompanied
by his man all the way.</p>


<p><i>A new and cheap conductor of
lightning and fluid.</i>&mdash;Mr. Capostolle,
Professor of Chemistry in the departments
of the Somme, affirms
that a rope of straw supplies the
place of the expensive metal conductors.
The experiments, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
has made in the presence of many
learned men and which have been
repeated by them, confirms as he
says that the lightning enters a rope
of straw placed in its way and passes
through it into the ground so
gently that the hand of a person
holding the rope at the time does not
perceive it. Mr. Capostolle brings
the following proof of this assertion.
It is well known says he that a severe
shock is received by a person
who immediately touches the Leyden
vial. But if a person takes a
rope of straw, only seven or eight inches
long, in his hand, and touches,
with the end of this rope a Leyden
vial, so strongly charged that an ox
might be killed by it, he will neither
see a spark, or feel the slightest
shock. According to Mr. Capostolle's
opinion, such conductor made
of straw, which would not cost alone
three francs, would be able to protect
an extent of sixty acres of
ground from hail; and if the houses
and fields were protected in this
manner, neither hail nor lightning
could do any damage to them.</p>


<p><i>Economy of Nature.</i>&mdash;In the sunshine
vegetables decompose the <em>carbonic
acid gas</em> of the atmosphere,
the <em>carbon</em> of which is absorbed, and
becomes a part of their organized
matter, but the <em>oxygen gas</em>, the
other constituent is given off; thus
the economy of vegetation is made
subservient to the general order of
the system of nature. Again, <em>Carbonic
acid gas</em> is formed in the respiration
of animals, and as yet no
process is known in nature by which
it can be consumed, except vegetation.
Animals thus produce a substance
which appears to be a necessary
food for vegetables;&mdash;vegetables
evolve a principle necessary to
the existence of animals: the two
kingdoms seem to be thus connected
together in the exercise of their
functions, and, to a certain extent,
made to depend upon each other for
their existence.</p>


<p><i>Legible Writing.</i>&mdash;The Grand
Duke of Baden has issued an ordinance,
enjoining all public functionaries
in his dominions, who sign
their names in an illegible manner,
through <em>affectation</em>, to write them in
future so that they can be read, under
the pain of having any document
illegibly signed, thrown back
on their hands.</p>

<p>While Mr. Samuel Chandler was
boring for salt near Zanesville, Ohio,
he found a metallic substance six
feet three inches thick, which being
analysed, was found to be silver, nearly
as pure as the common coin.
This singular account is attested in
the National Intelligencer by a member
of Congress.</p>


<p><i>Square Mile.</i>&mdash;It may be thought
wonderful that the whole population
of this country could stand on considerably
less than a square mile.
Allowing six men to a square yard,
the mile would accommodate <em>eighteen
millions five hundred and eighty
five thousand six hundred men!</em></p>


<p><i>Latitude of Trees in Sweden.</i>&mdash;From
the researches made in Sweden
on the different kinds of wood
indigenous to the country, it has
been ascertained that the birch
reaches the farthest north, growing
beyond the 70th degree; the pine
reaches to the 69th; the fir tree to
the 68th; the ozier, willow, aspen
and quince, to the 66th; the cherry
and apple tree to the 63d; the oak
to the 60th; and the beech to the
57th; while the lime tree, ash, elm,
poplar and walnut, are only to be
found in Scavia.</p>

<p><i>Singular Anecdote of the Spider,
by Capt. Bagnold.</i>&mdash;Desirous of ascertaining
the natural food of the
scorpion, I enclosed one (which measured
three fourths of an inch from
the head to the insertion of the tail)
in a wide mouthed phial, together
with one of those large spiders so
common in the West Indies, and
closed it with a cork, perforated by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
quill, for the admission of air: the
insects seemed carefully to avoid
each other, retiring to opposite ends
of the bottle, which was placed horizontally.
By giving it a gradual inclination,
the scorpion was forced into
contact with the spider, when a
sharp encounter took place, the latter
receiving repeated stings from
his venomous adversary, apparently
without the least injury, and with his
web, soon lashed the scorpion's tail
to his back, subsequently securing
his legs and claws with the materials.
In this state I left them some
time, in order to observe what effect
would be produced on the spider by
the wounds he had received. On
my return, however, I was disappointed,
the ants having entered and
destroyed them both.</p>

<p><i>Spontaneous Combustion.</i>&mdash;<i>From
the Baltimore Morning Chronicle.</i>&mdash;At
my mills there was an iron kettle
used for holding ashes&mdash;it had remained
with ashes in from the 5th
to the 9th month at which time
flaxseed oil was by accident spilled
into the ashes; in about 24 hours the
ashes were found to be on fire, and
wishing to have it fully ascertained,
whether it was the oil which occasioned
the ashes to take fire, I filled
a kettle with cold dry ashes, in which
I poured a pint of flaxseed oil, and
in 24 hours I examined it, and found
that, as far as the oil had penetrated
the ashes were in a state of combustion,
and, applying some shavings
and chips of wood, it immediately
caused them to blaze.</p>

<p>From an apprehension that many
buildings have been consumed by
fires from the foregoing cause, I have
been induced to give publicity to the
fact.</p>

that your correspondent <i>Davyana</i>
has made an <em>unsuccessful</em> experiment,
to verify the account given by Mr.

mixture of linseed oil and
wood ashes.</p>

<p>An experiment has also been
made, with a similar view, at the

ashes employed were chiefly from
hickery wood, well sifted, and cold;
and the quantity of linseed oil, one
pint. No change of temperature
was perceived, till about 46 hours after
the oil had been poured on the
ashes, when the mixture was fairly
ignited, and in a short time emitted
flame, which continued upwards of
an hour. After the flame had ceased,
the ignition continued for about
18 hours, and the ashes were then
poured out of the vessel.</p>

<p><i>Seed Potatoes.</i>&mdash;It has been recently
ascertained from the most decisive
experiments, that late potatoes,
or such as are not ripe, were the
best seed, and that planting such restores
a degenerated variety to its
original qualities. The discoverer of
this fact recommends the planting of
seed from cold and late situations,
and to plant so late as June and July,
taking up those unripe, and preserving
them as seed for the following
year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boring</span> <i>legalized</i>.&mdash;Last week we
mentioned that a silver mine was said
to have been discovered near Zanesville,
in Ohio. By the last Columbus
papers we are informed that the bill
incorporating the "Muskingum Silver
Mining Company" has passed the
legislature.</p>

<p>It is said that the rock about twenty
feet below the surface of the earth,
extends under nearly the whole territory
of Ohio; that the silver was
found after penetrating the rock about
100 feet; and that, therefore, there
is an even chance that this stratum of
silver, near 7 feet in thickness, is as
extensive as the state.</p>

<p>Verily, should this prove to be the
case, what an alteration would it make
in our affairs! Neighbouring states
would supply Ohio with corn and
whiskey&mdash;her keen speculators would
become lazy nabobs&mdash;Yankee pedlars
might venture to drive their trade
there, without danger of being <em>bitten</em>&mdash;her

that has been said to the contrary,

a <em>specie foundation</em>: and Owl Creek

<p>Capt. <span class="smcap">Symmes</span> has long expressed
great anxiety <em>to get into the earth</em>,
and, as it is a long journey to the
north pole, (where there is certainly
a hole big enough for Capt. Symmes
to get in) and the Captain says he cannot
undertake the journey for the
want of "disposable means,"&mdash;now,
therefore, this may be entirely a man&oelig;vre
of the captain's, or of his
friends, to get a cheap passage into
the earth, whereby he may embark
near home, and without expense in
the outfit. At any rate, we hope the
company will persevere in <em>boring</em>&mdash;it
is a good subject&mdash;for should they
either find silver or provide a passage
for Capt. Symmes, they will silence
the hungry complaints of many speculators&mdash;both
in real estate and in
the learned and fashionable <em>ologies</em> of

greatest part of the work; for although
there are nearly two hundred
men employed, and a great number
of horses, these are mostly for the
out-door work; the interior appears
quite solitary. Large rakes with
chains moved by an invisible power,
stir to the very bottom the immense
mass of malt in boilers 12 feet deep;
elevators which nobody touches, carry
up to the summit of the building
2500 bushels of malt a day, thence
distributed through wooden channels
to the different places where the process
is carried on.&mdash;Casks of truly
gigantic sizes are ready to receive
the liquors. One of them contains
3000 barrels.  Now, at 8 barrels to a
ton, this is equal to a ship of 375 tons.
By the side of this are other enormous
vessels, the smallest of which, containing
about 800 barrels, are worth
when full 3000 pounds sterling each.
All this immense apparatus is so arranged
that every part is accessible,
and the whole is contained under one
roof. The stock of liquor is estimated
at 300,000 pounds; the barrels
alone in which it is carried about to
customers cost 80,000 pounds; and
the whole capital is not less than half
a million sterling; 250,000 barrels of
beer are sold annually, which would
load a fleet of 150 merchantmen, of
the burden of 200 tons each. The
building is incombustible&mdash;walls of
brick, and floors of iron.</p>


<p><i>Africa.</i>&mdash;Several attempts are now
making to explore the interior of this
country, and a scheme for opening a
grand commercial intercourse with
Tumbuctoo and Sudan, has been planned,
which promises success through
the protection of the emperor of Morocco.</p>


<p><i>London Nov. 30.</i>&mdash;We learn by a
letter from the celebrated Italian traveller,
<i>M. Belzoni</i>, that he has recently
performed a journey into the
deserts of Lybia, to examine there
the environs and ruins of the temple
Jupiter Ammon. This journey lasted
50 days, during which time he saw
different ruins, several temples and
other remarkable objects. After having
traversed the desert, he arrived at
the place where the temple is supposed
to have existed. The country
was fertile, and he found some villages,
but the inhabitants of the country,
where, perhaps, for several centuries
a European had not been seen,
were very savage, and would not suffer
him to pass, because they imagined
that he was looking for treasures
in their country. The ruins of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
temple he discovered had been employed
in the construction of another
temple, which is already in part destroyed,
and in forming the foundation
of the cabins of a village. The most
remarkable thing, however, discovered
by <i>M. Belzoni</i> in those environs is
a spring of living water, of which <i>Herodotus</i>
makes mention, warm in the
morning and evening, cold at noon,
and boiling hot at midnight. <i>M. Belzoni</i>
has brought away some of this
water for the purpose of analysing it.</p>


<p><i>A Hint to Smokers.</i>&mdash;The city of
New York, is said to contain 130,000
inhabitants. Let 50,000 of them
smoke only three Spanish segars a
day, and it will amount in the year to
the enormous sum of $1,095,000; a
sum sufficient to pay the salary of the
President and Vice-President of the
United States, the Secretaries of
State, of the Treasury, of war, and of
the Navy, and of the Attorney, General,
for 20 years, 10 months, and 8
days.</p>

<p class="center"><i>An effectual Method of Preserving
Poultry houses free from Vermin.</i></p>

<p>Sir&mdash;As I do not know that you
have positively interdicted all communications
from farmer-<em>esses</em>, I
must ask you to record a grand discovery,
which I consider myself to
have made, in the noble art of&mdash;<em>raising
poultry</em>.</p>

<p>It may save much trouble to my
sister housewives, to whom, according
to the order prescribed by the
<em>lords of the creation</em>, this department
of domestic economy has been assigned.
It is well known, that in this
branch of our humble duties, the
greatest difficulty arises from our
poultry houses being so much infested
with <em>vermin</em>; or, to be more plain,
in the slang of the poultry yard, with
<em>chicken lice</em>. Now, I have proved, by
long experience, that they will not resort
to houses wherein the roots, nest
boxes, &amp;c. &amp;c. are made of <em>sassafras
wood</em>. You may smile, and ask me,
the <em>reason of it</em>: I am no philosopher,
but I tell you, <em>sassafras wood</em> will
keep lice out of hen houses: I know
it to be a fact, and when you will tell
me <em>why it is</em> that chips of cedar wood
or tobacco will keep woollen free
from <em>moth</em>, then I will endeavour to
tell you <em>why</em> it is, that sassafras wood
will keep away chicken lice&mdash;one is
universally known to be true, the
other no less true, though less known.</p>

<p>The London Globe, of Jan. 29,
says&mdash;"We understand that the lords
of the treasury have given directions
to allow mechanics, artificers, &amp;c. to
emigrate from Great Britain to any
country and in any ship.</p>

<p>At Brighton, the wildest of the feathered
tribe have been so punished
with the frost, that they have left the
woods, for warmer shelter in the habitations
of men. Black birds, starlings,
larks and thrushes have been
pursued by boys, at mid-day, and easily

<p>Whether the result of education and early
associations, or derived immediately from Nature
herself, there is excited in every bosom
possessed of sensibility, a sensation of awe
and veneration, when approaching the mansions
of the dead. Here the storm of passion
subsides into peace; and even savage ferocity,
when contemplating the house appointed for
all living, is moulded into mildness and mercy.
Who does not delight to behold the verdant
hillock, which designates the spot, where the
remains of a dear friend or relative are deposited,
decorated with vernal beauty, and
alike protected from the withering inroads of
neglect, and the rude approach of violence?
There is a chord in every feeling heart, which
vibrates in unison with the magic touch of
memory when delineating in vivid colours,
some departed object of our love and affection.
The <span class="smcap">GRAVE-YARD</span> furnishes a scene, in
which memory is necessarily a prominent actor.</p>

<span class="i0">Till his merchants brought suits for their dry goods and wines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Tom join'd the throng, and assisted the song,<br /></span>

<p>The following versification was from the
pen of a very young, and interesting woman,
in reply to the solicitations of her family not
to accompany her unfortunate husband into
exile.</p>

<p>The lovely author of these lines, whose
beauty can only be exceeded by her retiring
modesty, is wholly unconscious of their publication,
and we well know will blush at celebrity
which the accomplishments of her mind,
the graces of her person, and the misfortunes
of her destiny, have rendered inevitable.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Mr. Hume quotes with approbation an
author, who complains of the decay of tillage
in the reign of Elizabeth, and who
ascribes it to the increase of pasturage, in
consequence of the restraints imposed on
the exportation of grain, while that of butter,
cheese, &amp;c. was free. The history of
Europe, if read with an eye to public economy,
furnishes an abundant proof, that
the greatest obstructions to agriculture
have arisen from the interference of government.
We have here no sly allusion
to our own projects of a state board of
agriculture, of a chymico agricultural professorship,
nor even of an agricultural college,
if the treasury in its wealth, and the
legislature in its wisdom, should deem such
institutions useful or necessary.</p></div>

negligent or niggardly, if (as Fourcroy
asserts) the purest sand be a mixture of
quartz, alumina, and sometimes of calcareous
matter. <em>Speculative geology</em> is romance,
and does not merit the name of science;
yet is science obliged to borrow her theory
of soils. The alternation of heat and
cold, moisture and dryness, decomposed
the mountains of primitive, secondary and
tertiary formation; rains, and the laws of
gravity, brought these from places of more,
to places of less elevation&mdash;where, by mechanical
mixture and chymical combination,
the present substrata were formed. But
these were yet naked and unproductive,
when the Cryptogamia family (mopes and
lichens) took possession of them, and in
<em>due time</em> produced that vegetable matter,
which made the earth productive and the
globe habitable!</p></div>

black or brown powder, which the French
chymists call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terreau</i> or <em>humus</em>, and which
Mr. Davy calls an <em>extractive matter</em>; <em>this</em> is
the fertilizing principle of soils and manures.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The opinion is general among the
chymists of Europe, that magnesian earth
is not only barren itself, but the cause of

abound, unless saturated with carbonic

by the process of vegetation. His essay on
